### How to play

 - **TARGET**: Terminate all enemies and find Game Portal to complete a level. This is a small project so I created only 2 levels for testing purposes. Even if you find the Game Portal first, you still have to destroy all the enemies to finish the stage.
 - **CONTROL**: Use the arrow buttons to move Bomman. If there is a colission with enemies, you will die. Try to run away from them or block them with bombs.

### Tech

*  [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) - Game engine for Java language

And of course Bomman itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/Foot-runner/Bomman) on GitHub.

### Installation

Bomman game requires [Java SDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) v11 to run.
